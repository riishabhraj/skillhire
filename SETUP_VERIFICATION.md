### 3. No Job Posting Without Payment ‚úÖ
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Changes Made**:

#### API Route (`app/api/jobs/route.ts`):
- **Public Job Listing (GET)**: Only shows jobs with `paymentStatus: 'paid'` AND `status: 'active'`
- **Job Creation (POST)**: 
  - Requires `planType` ('basic' or 'premium')
  - Sets `paymentStatus: 'pending'`
  - Sets `status: 'paused'` (not 'active')
  - Job won't appear in public listings until payment is complete

#### Webhook Handler (`app/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts`):
- On successful payment (`order_created` event):
  - Updates `paymentStatus` to `'paid'`
  - Updates `status` to `'active'`
  - Records `lemonSqueezyOrderId` and `paidAt` timestamp

#### Job Posting Flow (`app/employer/post-job/page.tsx`):
- Step 0-3: Job details and requirements
- Step 4: Payment (NEW)
  - Job is created with pending status
  - User must complete Lemon Squeezy payment
  - After payment, webhook activates the job
  - Only then does job appear in public listings

**Critical Code**:
```typescript
// Only show paid jobs publicly
const query: any = { 
  status: 'active',
  paymentStatus: 'paid'
}
```

**Test**:
1. Create a job as employer
2. Complete all steps until payment
